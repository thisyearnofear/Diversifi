## üí± Mento Stablecoins Integration

DiversiFi leverages the Mento Protocol to enable seamless swaps between different regional stablecoins. Our integration includes:

### Supported Stablecoins

| Stablecoin | Region | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **cUSD**   | USA    | Celo Dollar - pegged to the US Dollar                |
| **cEUR**   | Europe | Celo Euro - pegged to the Euro                       |
| **cREAL**  | LatAm  | Celo Brazilian Real - pegged to the Brazilian Real   |
| **cKES**   | Africa | Celo Kenyan Shilling - pegged to the Kenyan Shilling |
| **cCOP**   | LatAm  | Celo Colombian Peso - pegged to the Colombian Peso   |
| **PUSO**   | Asia   | Philippine Peso - pegged to the Philippine Peso      |
| **cGHS**   | Africa | Celo Ghana Cedi - pegged to the Ghanaian Cedi        |
| **eXOF**   | Africa | CFA Franc - pegged to the West African CFA Franc     |

### Swap Implementation

Our swap functionality uses a multi-tiered approach:

1. **Direct Swaps**: When available, we use direct swaps through the Mento broker contract
2. **Two-Step Swaps**: For pairs without direct liquidity, we route through an intermediary token
3. **Simulated Swaps**: For demonstration purposes on testnets, we simulate swaps for pairs without liquidity

### Exchange Rate Discovery

- Real-time exchange rate calculations using the Mento broker
- Caching system to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Fallback rates for reliability when the network is unavailable

## üì± Testing with MiniPay

To test DiversiFi with MiniPay:

1. Start your development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev:diversifi  # From the root directory
   # Or from the apps/diversifi directory
   pnpm dev -p 3003  # Use any available port
   ```

2. Use ngrok to expose your local server:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3003  # Use the same port as your dev server
   ```

3. Open the MiniPay app on your Android device:

   - Go to Settings
   - Tap the version number repeatedly to enable developer mode
   - Go back to Settings and select "Developer Settings"
   - Enable "Developer Mode" and toggle "Use Testnet" if you want to use the Alfajores testnet
   - Tap "Load Test Page"
   - Enter your ngrok URL: `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xxx.ngrok-free.app/diversifi`
   - Click "Go" to launch your app in MiniPay

4. Alternatively, test with the live demo:
   - Open MiniPay
   - Go to Developer Settings as described above
   - Enter: `https://stable-station.netlify.app/diversifi`
   - Click "Go" to launch the app

## MiniPay Integration Learnings

### Key Requirements for MiniPay Compatibility

1. **Headers Configuration**:

   - Set `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` instead of `DENY` to allow embedding in MiniPay
   - Add `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' *.minipay.app *.celo.org *.opera.com;`

2. **Meta Tags**:

   ```html
   <meta
     name="viewport"
     content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"
   />
   <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
   <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
   <meta
     name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style"
     content="black-translucent"
   />
   ```

3. **Wallet Connection**:

   - Use the basic `window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" })` approach
   - Auto-connect when MiniPay is detected: `window.ethereum.isMiniPay === true`
   - Add a small delay (e.g., 500ms) before checking for MiniPay to ensure everything is loaded
   - Hide connect button when in MiniPay environment

4. **Chain Configuration**:

   - MiniPay only supports Celo and Celo Alfajores Testnet
   - Chain IDs: 42220 (Celo Mainnet), 44787 (Celo Alfajores Testnet)

5. **Transaction Requirements**:

   - MiniPay uses Custom Fee Abstraction based transactions
   - Support the `feeCurrency` property when sending transactions
   - Only accept legacy transactions (not EIP-1559)

6. **UI/UX Considerations**:
   - Mobile-first design with simple, clean UI
   - Avoid heavy animations or complex interactions
   - Use tabs for navigation on small screens
   - Ensure all interactive elements are large enough for touch

### Debugging MiniPay Integration

1. **Environment Detection**:

   ```javascript
   const isMiniPay = window.ethereum && window.ethereum.isMiniPay === true;
   const isInIframe = window !== window.parent;
   const userAgent = navigator.userAgent;
   const referrer = document.referrer || "None";
   ```

2. **Console Logging**:

   - Log detection results to console: `console.log('MiniPay detection:', { isMiniPay, userAgent, isInIframe, referrer });`
   - Log connection results: `console.log('Connected to wallet:', { address, chainId });`

3. **Visual Indicators**:

   - Show MiniPay badge when detected
   - Display connection status clearly
   - Show chain ID and network name

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Start with simple static HTML files to verify basic functionality
   - Test wallet connection separately from app functionality
   - Create a dedicated debug page with detailed environment information
