# Stable Station

## Description

Stable Station is a chat-based onboarding experience for Web3. We've evolved from a kit-based model to an action-based learning platform where users can:

- Complete specific actions
- Unlock features aligned with portfolio management, rebalancing, diversification & stablecoin procurement
- Track progress across different categories
- Learn through hands-on experience & ai assistance powered by agentkit

## How it's made

[stable-station.netlify.app/](https://stable-station.netlify.app/)

## Stack

We use:

- OpenAI LLM
- Vercel ai-sdk
- Agentkit for action orchestration
- Forked Vercel's AI Chatbot
- Onchainkit for displaying web3 components
- Drizzle ORM for database management
- ConnectKit for wallet management
- Framer Motion for animations
- SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) for authentication
- CoinGecko API for real-time token pricing
- Custom smart contracts for in-app swaps

## Deployment

### Netlify Deployment

To deploy this project on Netlify:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set the build command to `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build`
3. Set the publish directory to `.next`
4. Add the following environment variables:

Note: If you're adding dependencies during the build process, make sure to use the `-w` flag with pnpm to add them to the workspace root. For example: `pnpm add -D -w package-name`

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `POSTGRES_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (if using database features)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Your WalletConnect project ID
- `BRIAN_API_KEY`: Your Brian API key for Polygon DAI swaps
- Other environment variables as needed

The build process is configured to skip database migrations during the Netlify build process to avoid connection issues. Instead, you should run migrations manually after deployment using one of these methods:

1. **Run migrations locally against your production database:**

   ```bash
   POSTGRES_URL=your_production_db_url pnpm db:migrate
   ```

2. **Set up a separate CI/CD step or scheduled task to run migrations**

This approach ensures your database schema stays up-to-date without causing build failures.

We've built:

- Custom web3 login for Vercel's AI chatbot - next-auth compatible, powered by SIWE (backend session auth)
- Interactive in-chat experiences using structured model outputs from the ai-sdk
- AI-SDK <-> Agentkit tool wrapper
- ConnectKit wallet provider for Agentkit
- Custom interactive components in-chat (options, asking for help, connecting wallet, action cards)
- Simple memory solution for the agent across user chats
- Action-based learning system with rewards
- Multi-chain support (Base, Celo, Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism)

## Design Philosophy

### Desktop Experience

- The desktop layout is intentionally left untouched for maximum stability and familiarity.
- All desktop grid, sidebar, and main content classes remain as originally designed.

### Mobile & Small Screen Improvements

- Mobile enhancements are implemented using Tailwind's responsive utilities (e.g., `md:`, `sm:`, `block md:hidden`).
- Mobile-specific UI (navigation bars, overlays, alternate tab navigation, etc.) is added without affecting desktop.
- Conditional rendering is used for mobile-only components as needed.

#### Current/Future Mobile Improvements

- Bottom navigation bar (mobile only)
- Mobile-friendly tab navigation
- Profile/dashboard mobile layout

## Development

Requirements:

- Node 22
- pnpm
- Postgres

```bash
pnpm install
```

Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your own values
```

Run the development server:

```bash
# Set up the database
pnpm drizzle-kit push

# Seed the database with actions
pnpm db:seed

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

### Monorepo Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces:

```
/
├── apps/
│   ├── diversifi/         # MiniPay DiversiFi app
│   └── web/               # Main web app (if needed)

### Neynar MCP Setup

To set up the Neynar MCP (Mintlify Command Palette) for enhanced documentation search:

1. Install the Neynar MCP:

```bash
npx @mintlify/mcp@latest add neynar
```

2. Start the MCP server:

```bash
node /Users/udingethe/.mcp/neynar/src/index.js
```

The MCP server will run in the background and enable Neynar documentation search functionality directly from Cursor.

### DiversiFi Feature

We've also added a simplified DiversiFi teaser in the right sidebar that shows users their geographical portfolio diversification. This serves as a preview of the full DiversiFi feature that will be developed as a separate mini-app.

### Future DiversiFi Mini-App Plans

The full DiversiFi feature will include:

1. **Advanced Visualization Options**

   - World map visualization with highlighted regions based on user holdings
   - Circular visualization showing portfolio distribution

   - 3D globe representation of geographical exposure

2. **Comprehensive Diversification Metrics**

   - Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for measuring concentration
   - Shannon Entropy for measuring information diversity
   - Geographic Spread Ratio for measuring regional allocation
   - Custom diversification scores & insight/analytics

3. **Portfolio Rebalancing Insights**

   - Recommendations for improving geographical diversification
   - Suggested trades to achieve optimal diversification
   - Risk analysis based on geographical exposure
   - Historical performance analysis by region

4. **Interactive User Experience**
   - Ability to simulate portfolio changes and see impact on diversification
   - Customizable visualization options
   - Detailed token information and regional context
   - Educational content about the benefits of geographical diversification
