# Web3 Integration Guidelines

## Purpose

The Web3 integration system connects the Hello World Computer application with blockchain networks, allowing users to interact with smart contracts, manage wallets, and perform on-chain actions.

## Core Components

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - ConnectKit for wallet connection UI
   - Wagmi hooks for wallet interaction
   - Support for multiple wallet providers

2. **Authentication**
   - Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) for Web3 authentication
   - Session management with cookies
   - Protected routes and API endpoints

3. **Blockchain Interaction**
   - AgentKit for AI-powered blockchain interactions
   - Support for multiple chains (Base, Ethereum, Celo)
   - Transaction management and status tracking

4. **Action System**
   - Based Actions for Base ecosystem
   - Stable Actions for Celo ecosystem
   - Global Actions for Ethereum ecosystem

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Use the `Web3Provider` component to wrap the application
   - Use the `useAccount` hook to access wallet information
   - Handle connection errors gracefully
   - Provide clear instructions for users

2. **Authentication**
   - Use the `auth()` function to get the current session
   - Use the `generateSiweChallenge` and `verifySiwe` functions for authentication
   - Store session data in cookies
   - Handle authentication errors gracefully

3. **Blockchain Interaction**
   - Use the `setupAgentKit` function to initialize AgentKit
   - Use the appropriate wallet provider based on the environment
   - Handle blockchain interaction errors gracefully
   - Provide feedback to users during blockchain operations

4. **Action System**
   - Organize actions by category and difficulty
   - Provide clear instructions for each action
   - Track action completion and provide rewards
   - Allow users to share their achievements

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages for users
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed transactions
   - Log errors with appropriate context

2. **Performance**
   - Minimize blockchain calls
   - Use caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize gas usage for transactions
   - Use batching for multiple operations

3. **Security**
   - Never expose private keys or sensitive information
   - Validate all user input
   - Use secure RPC endpoints
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

4. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear feedback during blockchain operations
   - Show loading states during transactions
   - Use toast notifications for transaction status
   - Provide transaction history and status tracking

## Supported Chains

- Base (Mainnet and Sepolia)
- Ethereum (Mainnet)
- Celo (Mainnet)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-chain Support**
   - Add support for additional chains
   - Implement cross-chain operations
   - Provide chain-specific features

2. **Enhanced Wallet Integration**
   - Support for hardware wallets
   - Multi-signature wallet support
   - Social recovery options

3. **Advanced Transaction Management**
   - Gas estimation and optimization
   - Transaction simulation
   - Transaction batching
   - Transaction scheduling
