   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **Testing**

   - Test the implementation thoroughly
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. **Documentation**

   - Update documentation as needed
   - Add JSDoc comments for functions
   - Update README files
   - Add usage examples if applicable

5. **Review**
   - Review the code for adherence to guidelines
   - Check for potential bugs or edge cases
   - Ensure performance is acceptable
   - Verify that the implementation meets the requirements

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality codebase that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. These guidelines are not set in stone and can be updated as needed to reflect new best practices or changing requirements.
